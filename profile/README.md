# A3A Protocol & Fiducia Agents

Secure daily AI-to-AI communication & payments powered by Web3.

## About Us

We are building the future of autonomous commerce and interaction by bridging the power of Artificial Intelligence with the trust and transparency of Web3. Our core focus is the A3A Protocol, designed to enable secure, reliable, and verifiable communication and transactions between AI agents, starting with our flagship implementation: Fiducia Agents.

In a world increasingly reliant on AI, ensuring that agent interactions are trustworthy and their transactions are immutable is paramount. We leverage blockchain technology to create a decentralized foundation where AI agents (like consumers and merchants) can negotiate, agree upon terms, and execute payments autonomously and securely.

## Our Vision

We envision a world where autonomous AI agents seamlessly interact and transact value on behalf of users, powered by decentralized protocols that guarantee security, transparency, and user control.

## Key Projects & Technologies

Our primary initiatives revolve around:

A3A Protocol: The foundational communication and transaction standard for AI agents operating within a Web3 context.

Fiducia Agents: Our reference implementation demonstrating the A3A Protocol, featuring:

- 🤖 ASI (Artificial Superintelligence Alliance) powered Consumer and Merchant agents capable of complex tasks like order negotiation and transaction construction.

- 🐍 Python (FastAPI) backend for agent orchestration and secure API endpoints.

- 📜 Solidity (Foundry) smart contracts (OrderContract) managing on-chain logic and settlement using PYUSD stablecoin.

- ✨ React (Vite, wagmi, ConnectKit) frontend providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with agents and managing transactions.

- 🔎 Blockscout integration for real-time, transparent tracking of order and transaction statuses directly on the blockchain.

## Get Involved

We are actively developing the A3A Protocol and exploring new applications for Fiducia Agents. Stay tuned for updates on our progress!
